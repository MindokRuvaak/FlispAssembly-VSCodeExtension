# FlispAssembly-VSCodeExtension
Creating a VSCode extension for writing assembly code for FLIS-Processors. 
I don't like the DigiFlisp program and would rather write the .sflisp, .fmem and .fcs files in text files than use the DigiFlisp tools.
Since I couldn't find a VSCode extension I thought "why not create one?" and here we are.
